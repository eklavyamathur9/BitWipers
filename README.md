# BitWipers - Secure Data Wiping for Trustworthy IT Asset Recycling

## Overview

BitWipers is a secure, cross-platform data wiping application designed to address India's e-waste crisis by providing trustworthy data sanitization for IT asset recycling. The tool ensures complete data erasure with verifiable proof, encouraging safe disposal and reuse of electronic devices.

## Problem Statement

India generates over 1.75 million tonnes of e-waste annually, with over ₹50,000 crore worth of IT assets being hoarded due to data security concerns. BitWipers provides a solution by offering:

- **Secure Data Erasure**: Complete elimination of user data including hidden storage areas (HPA/DCO) and SSD sectors
- **Tamper-Proof Certificates**: Digitally signed wipe certificates in PDF and JSON formats
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive one-click operation suitable for general public use
- **Offline Operation**: Bootable ISO/USB support for standalone operation
- **Third-Party Verification**: Verifiable wipe status for transparency
- **Standards Compliance**: Aligned with NIST SP 800-88 guidelines

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Multi-platform support (Windows, Linux, Android)
- Secure overwrite patterns for HDDs
- SSD secure erase commands (TRIM/ATA Secure Erase)
- Hidden area detection and erasure (HPA/DCO)
- Real-time progress monitoring

### Security & Verification
- Digital certificate generation with cryptographic signatures
- JSON and PDF certificate formats
- Tamper-proof verification system
- Third-party validation support

### User Experience
- One-click data wiping interface
- Intuitive GUI with progress indicators
- Detailed device information display
- Error handling and recovery options

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
